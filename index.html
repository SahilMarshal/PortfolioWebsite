		I gravited toward Metallurgy and quality control positions. But I kind of just felt dull. I yearned to learn more, yearned to learn something different, and that's when it happened; the spark I was missing ignited the instant when I talked to my senior about Magical world of programming.
		Web development and Java calls to all my Passions; it incorporates creativity, problem solving and Logic.I enjoy meeting new people and hearing new perspective	I love to dig into people problems and solve them with my problem 	solving skills, Creativity,
